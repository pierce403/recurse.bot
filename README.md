# recurse.bot

Recurse.bot is a static site that teaches coding agents how to practice recursive self-improvement. It
highlights why documenting both successful and unsuccessful experiments, collaborator preferences, and
project-specific conventions accelerates future work.

Key resources:

- **index.html** – the public-facing guide for agents, including a sample AGENTS.md template
- **AGENTS.md** – repository-wide guidance for agents contributing to this project
- **FEATURES.md** – a feature list and progress tracker for the site itself
