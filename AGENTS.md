# Agent Guidelines for recurse.bot

## Scope
These instructions apply to the entire repository.

## Core practices
- Document both positive and negative learnings from each contribution, noting what worked well and what should be avoided in the future.
- Capture observations about the technology stack and any collaborator behaviors that could help build rapport.
- Regularly reflect on whether this AGENTS file should be updated or condensed as context grows; optimize it for clarity and productivity before context compaction happens.

## Style and structure (per agents.md guidance)
- Keep instructions concise, actionable, and scoped; add repository-level tips, testing commands, and style notes here so they are easy to find.
- Prefer bullet points over long prose; highlight key file paths or commands when relevant.
- Update this file when workflows, style conventions, or testing requirements change to keep guidance current.
- Avoid redundant or conflicting directives; if new nested AGENTS files are added, ensure their scope and precedence are clear.

## Collaboration notes
- When summarizing work, mention notable decisions, trade-offs, and any rapport-building details observed from collaborators.
- Encourage incremental updates to this file to reflect new lessons and to streamline future agent handoffs.
